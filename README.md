# Using and Testing Web Services - Tutorial

---

# **Web services**
Web services are a fundamental component of modern software architecture that enable different applications or systems to communicate and share data over the internet. They serve as a bridge between various platforms, allowing them to interact with each other regardless of the technologies they are built upon. Web services play a crucial role in enabling interoperability and data exchange in distributed computing environments.

Here are some key characteristics for understanding web services:
 
* **Interoperability:** Web services are designed to work across different programming languages, operating systems, and platforms. This means that applications written in different technologies can communicate seamlessly through web services.

* **Communication Protocol:** Web services use standardized communication protocols, most commonly HTTP or HTTPS, to exchange data. This makes it easy to transmit data over the internet.

* **Data Format:** Web services use standard data formats for data exchange, such as XML (eXtensible Markup Language) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). These formats ensure that data is structured and can be understood by both the sender and receiver.

* **API (Application Programming Interface):** Web services are often accessed using APIs, which define how different software components should interact with each other. APIs provide a set of functions and protocols for building and integrating software.

* **Types of Web Services:** There are different types of web services based on their functionality. These include:
  * _SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):_ SOAP is a structured protocol for exchanging information using XML-based messaging. 
  * _REST (Representational State Transfer):_ REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to communicate with resources represented by URLs. It's known for its simplicity and scalability.
  * _GraphQL:_ GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of information.

## **Why should we use Web Services in Applications?**
  Web services offer several advantages in modern software development:
  * **Interoperability:** Different applications can communicate seamlessly, regardless of their technology stack.
  * **Modularity and Reusability:** Web services can be modularized and reused across multiple applications.
  * **Scalability:** Services can be scaled independently to handle varying levels of demand.
  * **Platform Independence:** Web services use standardized protocols, making them suitable for cross-platform development.
  * **Global Accessibility:** Web services can be accessed over the internet, enabling global connectivity.

## **Understanding REST in Communication**
In our tutorial, we will focus on REST architecture because it simplifies the interaction between software applications through a set of constraints, fostering a structured and efficient approach to communication. At its core, REST emphasizes the utilization of standard HTTP methods for resource manipulation, creating a consistent and intuitive framework for data exchange.

RESTful communication relies on a client-server model where clients, often web browsers or applications, initiate requests to servers. These requests carry specific HTTP methods that define the desired action. Servers, in response, provide well-structured data, often in formats like JSON or XML, ensuring seamless interpretation by the client.

**Decoding Interaction: HTTP Status Codes**

In this symbiotic communication between clients and servers, the language of HTTP status codes allows to convey the outcomes of each interaction.
The main examples of HTTP status codes are:

**1. Informational Responses (1xx):**
   - **100 Continue:** Acknowledgment of the initial request, indicating the server's readiness for further data transmission.

**2. Successful Responses (2xx):**
   - **200 OK:** Successful processing of the request, with the server delivering the desired data in the response body.
   - **201 Created:** The request leads to the establishment of a new resource on the server.
   - **204 No Content:** Although successful, no data needs to be included in the response body.

**3. Redirection Responses (3xx):**
   - **301 Moved Permanently:** The requested resource has undergone a permanent relocation to a new URL.
   - **302 Found (or 303 See Other):** Temporary redirection to a different URL for the requested resource.
   - **304 Not Modified:** The client's cached resource version remains valid, resulting in a response without re-transmission.

**4. Client Error Responses (4xx):**
   - **400 Bad Request:** The server struggles to comprehend the client's request due to errors or malformed syntax.
   - **401 Unauthorized:** Access requires valid authentication credentials.
   - **403 Forbidden:** Authenticated client lacks the necessary permissions to access the resource.
   - **404 Not Found:** The requested resource is absent on the server.
   - **405 Method Not Allowed:** The requested HTTP method is incompatible with the resource.

**5. Server Error Responses (5xx):**
   - **500 Internal Server Error:** Unforeseen server error disrupts the request fulfillment.
   - **501 Not Implemented:** The server lacks the functionality to fulfill the request.
   - **503 Service Unavailable:** Temporary server unavailability due to maintenance or overload.

This tutorial is designed to provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively interact with APIs. Throughout this tutorial, you'll gain a solid understanding of the concepts that underpin APIs and learn practical techniques for interacting with them. We'll cover various aspects, from making simple API requests to handling more complex scenarios like authentication, error handling, and data manipulation. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with the tools to confidently communicate with APIs, retrieve and exchange data, and integrate external functionalities into your own projects. 

---

Before delving into the technical details, let's try to understand two fundamental concepts: what an API is and the significance of API testing.

**What is an API?**

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a bridge that enables different software systems to communicate and interact with each other. Think of it as a language that allows various applications to share data and functionalities seamlessly. Just as a waiter acts as an intermediary between you and the kitchen in a restaurant, an API facilitates communication between different software components, even if they're developed using different technologies.

**What is API Testing?**

API testing is the process of rigorously assessing the reliability, functionality, and performance of APIs. Much like quality control for products, API testing ensures that APIs operate as expected. It involves sending specific requests to an API and analyzing the responses it generates. By doing so, we verify that APIs deliver accurate and consistent results while adhering to predefined standards.

With these foundational concepts in mind, we're ready to explore the technical aspects of diverse open-source APIs, all orchestrated through the versatile platform of Postman.

## **Postman**
**What is Postman?**
Postman is a versatile and widely-used software tool designed to simplify the process of developing, testing, and documenting APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides developers, testers, and API consumers with a user-friendly interface for interacting with APIs, making the testing and integration of APIs more efficient and effective.

At its core, Postman offers the following key functionalities:

1. **API Requests:** Postman allows users to send various types of API requests, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. These requests can be tailored to specific API endpoints, enabling users to interact with APIs and retrieve or manipulate data.

2. **Request Customization:** Users can customize API requests by adding headers, parameters, request bodies, authentication details, and more. This flexibility ensures that requests can be accurately configured to match API requirements.

3. **Response Inspection:** Postman provides a visual representation of API responses, making it easy to analyze and verify data returned by the API. Responses are often displayed in formats like JSON or XML for easy interpretation.

4. **Collection Organization:** Postman allows users to organize related requests into collections, making it convenient to manage and execute multiple requests as part of a workflow or test suite.

5. **Environment Variables:** Users can set up environment variables to store and reuse values across requests. This is particularly useful for scenarios where data from one request needs to be used in subsequent requests.

6. **Automation:** Postman supports test scripting using JavaScript, enabling users to create automated test suites to validate API responses. This is essential for ensuring the correctness and reliability of APIs.

7. **API Documentation:** Postman can automatically generate API documentation based on the requests and descriptions provided by users. This documentation is helpful for sharing API information with other developers.

We are going to present each key functionality of Postman throughout the tutorial in order to guide the audience through a comprehensive understanding of Postman's functionalities.

## **Setting Up the Environment**

### **API Selection**
Throughout the upcoming operations, we will be utilizing a [straightforward open-source API](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md) to illustrate the fundamental CRUD operations. The acronym CRUD encapsulates the essential actions of Create, Read, Update, and Delete:

- **Create (Post):** This operation is employed to generate new resources or to potentially modify the underlying state of a system.

- **Read (Get):** The Read operation is used to retrieve a representation of a specific resource.

- **Update (Put/Patch):** Through the Update operation, existing resources can be modified or updated.

- **Delete (Delete):** The Delete operation comes into play when the objective is to remove a resource.

### Prerequisites 
To ensure the accuracy and precision of your actions throughout the tutorial, there are several crucial steps that require your attention:
* **Installing a Web Browser:** In order to correctly test APIs, download a Web Browser such as Google Chrome
* **Installing and Configuring Postman:** Here's what you need to do for installing the API testing platform Postman:

  1. **Download and Install:** Go to the [Postman download page](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and choose the version suitable for your operating system. Install it by following the on-screen instructions.

  2. **Sign Up/Login:** Once installed, open Postman. You can sign up for a free account or log in if you already have one. This allows you to sync your work across devices. Postman simplifies API testing by providing a user-friendly interface and a range of features that help you understand and interact with APIs effectively.

### **Collection creation in Postman**
Once you have installed Postman, you can organize your APIs requests into collections. Let's create, thus, a Collection where wi will can save the more usefull requests.

Here's how to create a collection in Postman:

1. **Collections Tab:** In the left sidebar, click on the `Collections` tab. This is where you'll manage your collections.

2. **Create New Collection:** At the top of the `Collections` tab, you'll see a `New` button. Click on it to create a new collection.

3. **Name and Description:** A window will pop up prompting you to enter a name and an optional description for your collection. Provide a meaningful name that reflects the purpose of the collection.

4. **Add Requests to the Collection:** Once your collection is created, you can start adding requests to it. To do this, you can:

   - Create new requests directly within the collection.
   - Import requests from other sources like URLs or cURL commands.
   - Duplicate existing requests and modify them as needed.

   To add a request:
   
   - Click on the collection you created.
   - Click the `Add a request` button within the collection.
   - Give the request a name and specify the HTTP method, URL, headers, parameters, and body as required.

5. **Save and Use:** Make sure to save your collection and your requests. You can now use this collection to execute requests, organize your API testing workflow, and collaborate with others.

### **Environments in Postman**
Setting up environments in Postman is a fundamental step that enables you to manage variables and configurations for your requests and tests. Environments allow you to switch between different sets of variables and values easily. 

Here's how to set up an environment in Postman:

1. **Access Environments:** On the top-right corner of the Postman interface, you'll see an "Environment" dropdown. Click on it to open the environment manager.

2. **Manage Environments:** In the environment manager, you can create, edit, and manage different environments. To get started, click on "Manage Environments."

### **Global Variables vs Environment Variables in Postman**

When it comes to creating and utilizing variables in Postman, it's important to understand the distinction between Global Variables and Environment Variables. 

**Global variables**
Global variables are those variables that are accessible and consistent across all API requests and scripts within a Postman collection. These variables can be defined and set to specific values, and once defined, they can be used in any request, pre-request script, test script, or environment script throughout the entire collection. 

To create and manage global variables in Postman, follow these steps:

1. Click on the environment quick look icon within the workbench.
2. Adjacent to `Globals`, click the `Edit` button (or `Add` if variables haven't been added yet).
3. Create a variable named `token` and input the acquired token value.
4. Click the `Save` icon and then close the environment tab.

**Environment Variables**
Environment variables in Postman are variables that are specific to a particular environment within a Postman collection. Environment variables are particularly useful when you need to work with different sets of data or configurations based on the environment you are testing in, such as development, testing, or production.

To effectively create and manage environment variables in Postman, follow these straightforward steps:

1. Locate the environment quick look icon within the workbench.
2. Choose an existing environment from the list or create a new one to suit your needs.
3. Integrate variables into the environment by assigning names and corresponding values, as previously mentioned.

Within your API requests, you can now employ the variables you've defined in your environment. For instance, in the request URL, reference the value stored in the variable using `{{variable_name}}`.

   - Example URL: `https://api.example.com?key={{apiKey}}`

Try it yourself.

### EXERCISE 0: **Variable creation:**
Create the variable "baseUrl" with value selected APIs' base URL `https://simple-books-api.glitch.me` in the environment "API testing".

---
## **API testing with Postman**
### **Client Keys and Token: user authentication**
Many APIs require a subscription fee, making it crucial to obtain a personal key or token to access them. Usually, this key is added as a query parameter when interacting with the server.

To utilize the selected [APIs](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md), an access token is required. An access token is a string that holds vital credentials and permissions, enabling access to specific resources. The process of obtaining an access token involves user authentication. This authentication is carried out using a POST request, which typically includes login details like username and email in the request body. Through this process, an access token is acquired, enabling subsequent requests for specific resources. 

Here's how you can retrieve it:

1. **Create a New POST Request:**
   - In the request tab, you can provide a suitable name for your request, such as "API Client Registration."
   - Select the HTTP method as "POST". We will see the POST method in more detail later on.
3. **Set the Request URL:**
   - Enter the URL for the API endpoint: `{{baseUrl}}/api-clients/`.
4. **Add Request Body:**
   - In the request tab, select the "Body" tab below the URL field.
   - Choose the "raw" option and select "JSON" from the dropdown.
   - Copy and paste the example JSON body you provided earlier into the text area:
```
{
  "clientName": "your-clientName",
  "clientEmail": "your-email@example.com"
}
```
Upon successful registration, the response will provide an access token. This token remains valid for a period of 7 days.

### **GET mathod**
With the acquired tokend, we're ready to delve into our tutorial. To initiate, let's execute a GET request to the `/status` endpoint.This will help us learn how to perform GET requests and check the current status of the API. 

1. **Create a New Request:**
   - Select the HTTP method as "GET."

2. **Set the Request URL:**
   - Enter the URL for the API endpoint you want to query. In this case, it's `{{baseUrl}}/status`.
  
If the request succeded, we get the status of the API. At this point, it is important to understand the response from the server.

### **Understanding responds**
In Postman, when you send requests to APIs, you might encounter different types of responses, including success responses and error responses. These responses are accompanied by status codes, which are standardized numerical codes that provide information about the outcome of the request. 

Here's a brief overview of status codes in Postman:

* **Success Response (2xx):** Receiving a `2xx` code (e.g., `200 OK`) denotes a successful request. You'll often find your anticipated data in the response body.

* **Client Error (4xx):** A `4xx` code (e.g., `404 Not Found`) signifies a client-side glitch. It might mean the sought-after resource is absent (`404`), or authentication is lacking (`401 Unauthorized`).

* **Server Error (5xx):** A `5xx` code (e.g., `500 Internal Server Error`) signals server-side issues. These could stem from misconfigured settings or backend snags.

* **Other Codes (1xx, 3xx):** Less frequent, these codes in the `1xx` and `3xx` range have distinct roles in communication and redirection scenarios.

Try it yourself.

### EXERCISE 1: **List Books:**
Looking at [Book APIs documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md), try to retrieve the list of available books.

---

### **Path Parameters**

Path parameters are a powerful tool for creating dynamic and precise URLs that help you access specific resources. They are variable segments within the path of a URL that enable you to pass dynamic values that act as identifiers for specific resources. 

To set up a path parameter, you use key-value pairs directly within the URL path. Suppose you are working with an API that provides information about books, and you want to retrieve details about a specific book using its unique ID. Here's how you would structure the URL with a path parameter:
```
https://example-book-api.com/books/:bookID
```

In practical terms, this means replacing `:bookID` with the actual ID value when crafting your request.

Working with path parameters becomes remarkably seamless when using tools such as Postman. The process involves effortlessly integrating the parameters into your request URL and replacing them with the appropriate corresponding values.

It's crucial to use the correct path parameter values. If you use the wrong value or format, the server will respond with a "404: Not Found" error. This is because the server cannot locate the resource you're trying to access.

Try it yourself.

### **Exercise 2: Exploring Book Information**
Refer to the [Book APIs documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md) try to retrieve detailed information about the book with the ID of 2.

--

### **Query Parameters:**

Query parameters are additional details you can attach to a URL in Postman. They're key-value pairs that come after a question mark (`?`) in the URL. These parameters customize your API requests by providing extra information to the server.

**How to Use Them in Postman:**
Assuming you're working with the Book API and you want to retrieve a list of books based on different filters.

1. **Open Postman:**
   Launch Postman and either create a new request or open an existing one.

2. **Select the "Params" Tab:**
   In the request window, click on the "Params" tab located below the URL field.

3. **Add Query Parameters:**
   In the "Params" tab, you'll see two columns: "Key" and "Value". Here's how you might add query parameters for filtering books:
   - **Key:** genre
     **Value:** thriller
   - **Key:** author
     **Value:** Stephen King

   You can continue adding more parameters as needed.

4. **Review URL:**
   As you add the query parameters, observe that the URL in the main URL field automatically updates to include the parameters. It should look something like:
   ```
   https://example-book-api.com/books?genre=thriller&author=Stephen%20King
   ```
   
---
Try it yourself.

### EXERCISE 3: **List Books:**
Looking at [Book APIs documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md), try to retrieve the list of available books of non-fiction genre.

---

### **Data trasmission**
To conclude, Postman allows us to send data to the server, whether in the form of JSON, form data, or other formats, involves adding a request body to the API request. This functionality is commonly utilized with HTTP methods like POST, PUT, and PATCH, which are employed to either update or create resources on the server. 

The steps to achieve this are as follows:

1. **Access the "Body" Tab:** Within the API request, navigate to the "Body" tab.
2. **Choose Data Format:** From this tab, you can opt for the appropriate data format that matches the content you're sending in the request body. Common data formats include JSON, form-data, x-www-form-urlencoded, and raw text.

---
Try it yourself.

### EXERCISE 4: **Order a book:**
Looking at [Book APIs documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md), try to create a new order. Remember that this process involves authenticating with an access token and providing necessary order details in JSON format.

### EXERCISE 5: **Order changes:**
Looking at [Book APIs documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md), try to change the customer's name of the first order in "Mario".

### EXERCISE 6: **Delete order:**
Looking at [Book APIs documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md), try to delete the last order submitted.

---

### **Automating Tests in Postman**
In Postman it is possible to perform tests on software applications, systems, or components by using automated tools and scripts. Test automation is commonly used in software development to ensure the quality, reliability, and efficiency of software products.

**1. Creating Test Scripts:**

Postman allows you to create test scripts for each API request using JavaScript. These scripts are executed after sending a request and can be used to verify the response's correctness, status, and other attributes. Here's how you can create a test script within Postman:

* **Navigate to "Tests" Tab:** In the request editor, switch to the "Tests" tab. This is where you'll write your test scripts.

* **Write Your Test Script:** Use JavaScript to write your test script. For example, to check the response status code and verify the presence of certain data in the response, you can write:

```
// Check response status code
pm.test("Status code is 200 OK", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

// Verify presence of specific data in response JSON
pm.test("Response body contains expected data", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.key).to.eql("expectedValue");
});
```

* **Execute the Request:** After writing the test script, you can click the "Send" button to execute the request. Postman will send the request to the API and then run your test scripts to validate the response.

**2. Chaining Requests:**

Chaining requests in Postman involves using the response from one request as input for subsequent requests. This is useful for scenarios where you need to perform a sequence of API calls. Here's how you can chain requests and automate scenarios:

* **Create Multiple Requests:** Create the API requests you want to chain. Let's say you have two requests: "Request A" and "Request B".

* **Reference Response Data:** In "Request A", you can save data from the response using Postman variables. For example, if the response contains an "id" that you want to use in "Request B", you can save it like this in the "Tests" tab of "Request A":

```
var responseJson = pm.response.json();
pm.environment.set("savedId", responseJson.id);
```

* **Chaining Requests:** In "Request B", you can reference the saved data in "Request A" using the Postman variable. You might include this variable in the URL or headers, depending on your use case:

```
// Use the saved ID from Request A
var savedId = pm.environment.get("savedId");

// Now use this ID in your request URL or headers
pm.sendRequest({
    url: "https://api.example.com/resource/" + savedId,
    method: "GET"
});
```

* **Execute Chained Requests:** When you execute "Request A", the response data is saved to the environment variable. Then, when you execute "Request B", it uses the saved data from the environment variable to build the URL or headers.

This way, you can automate scenarios where data from one request is needed in subsequent requests, creating a chain of automated API calls.

Try it yourself.

### EXERCISE 7: **Delete order:**
Looking at [Book APIs documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md), get the book information as follow:
- Retrieve the id of the book "Just as I Am"
- Order the book based on the saved variable id

---
### **API testing with Python**
API testing can be done in various programming languages, but some languages are more commonly used due to their libraries, frameworks, and ease of use. Python is a highly popular choice for API testing due to its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries. The `requests` library makes it easy to send HTTP requests and handle responses. Testing frameworks like `unittest`, `pytest`, and `nose` provide structured testing capabilities. In tis tutorial we will focus on pytest.

Here's a guide on how to use and test APIs in Python.


1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   For testing the APIs, you might need additional libraries. For example, the `requests` library for making HTTP requests.

   ```
   pip install pytest requests

   ```

2. **Make API Requests**:
   Use the `requests.get()` or other appropriate methods to make API requests. Here an example. 

   ```
   import requests
   
   # Define the URL
   url = "https://simple-books-api.glitch.me/status"
   
   # Make the GET request
   response = requests.get(url)

   # Check the response status code
   if response.status_code == 200:
      data = response.json()
      print("API response data:")
      print(data)
   else:
      print("API request failed with status code:", response.status_code)
   ```

3. **Handle Responses**:
   Parse and process the responses based on the API's data format (usually JSON). Perform error handling and validation as needed.

**Testing Web Services**

1. **Choose a Testing Framework**:
   Select a testing framework such as `unittest`, `pytest`, or `nose` for structuring and running your tests. We have chosen pytest.

2. **Create Test Cases**:
   Write test cases to cover different scenarios. If you want to use pytest to test the code in your test.py file, you need to wrap the code within a test function and include assertions to check the behavior of the code. pytest uses a specific naming convention to identify test functions. By default, it looks for functions that start with test_. In this example, the code has been encapsulated within the test_status_api_request function, which follows the naming convention required by pytest. 

Here an example of how you could structure the code as a pytest test:

   ```
   import requests

   def test_status_api_request():
    # Define the URL and optional parameters
    url = "https://simple-books-api.glitch.me/status"
    params = {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}

    # Make the GET request
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)

    # Check the response status code
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # Convert JSON response to Python data
    data = response.json()

    # Check if the expected key is in the response data
    assert "status" in data
    assert data["status"] == "OK"

    print("API response data:")
    print(data)

   ```

4. **Running Tests**:
   For running the test, you can simply run

   ```
   pytest -v test.py
   ```

**Parameterized Testing with pytest**

`pytest` also supports parameterized testing using the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator. This allows you to run the same test function with different sets of inputs. Here's an example of parameterized test for retrieving book details with different IDs. 

```
import requests
import pytest

BASE_URL = "https://simple-books-api.glitch.me"

@pytest.mark.parametrize("book_id", [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
def test_get_book_details(book_id):

    url = f"{BASE_URL}/books/{book_id}"
    response = requests.get(url)

    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "id" in data
    assert "name" in data
    assert "type" in data
    assert "available" in data

    print("API response data:")
    print(data)

```
---
Try it yourself.

### **Exercise 8: Exploring Book Information**
Refer to the [Book APIs documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md) try to:
* Handle Invalid Book IDs: write a test to verify the behavior when using an invalid book ID (e.g., 0, -1) with the "https://simple-books-api.glitch.me/books/:bookID" endpoint. Assert that the response status code is 404 (Not Found).
* Test Submitting an order: write a test to verify the behavior when submitting a new order using the "https://simple-books-api.glitch.me/orders" endpoint.
  * Prepare the request body in JSON format. The body should include the properties "bookId" (integer) and "customerName" (string).
  * Add the required authentication header using a token. 
  * Use the requests.post method to send the POST request.
  * Assert that the response status code is 200 (OK), indicating a successful order submission.
